5) Explain what an RDBMS is and what SQL is briefly.

An RDBMS is a relational database, or a collection of interrelated data, that is highly structured and follows the rules of ACID.
SQL stands for "structured query language" and is a standardized way of interacting with the database to define (ddl) and manipulate (dml) data. 
Briefly, SQL enables change and analysis on the data stored in the RDBMS.
